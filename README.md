## Hi there 👋
<img src="./floatrx.png" alt="floatrx" style="max-width: 100%; width: 300px;">

My name is Andrew Floatrx.

I'm a frontend craftsman with 15+ years in IT, specializing in TypeScript, React, Next.js, and clean UI/UX architecture.  
My code style? Minimalist, modular, and pragmatic — always optimized for maintainability and developer happiness.

### About me

I started my career as a web designer back in 2010, building strong UI/UX foundations that I still carry into every line of code.  
Since 2014, I've been crafting complex web apps as a frontend developer, with a growing passion for full-stack engineering.

I'm currently open to new projects and freelance opportunities.  
I also offer consulting and architecture audits to help improve performance, code quality, and scalability — especially within the React ecosystem.

- 🔭 Currently focused on my own pet projects  
- 🌱 Learning Node.js and exploring full-stack architecture
